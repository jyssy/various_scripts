 htop # interactive process viewer

 iostat l # display i/o stats

 usermod -aG

 cp -r source_directory destination

 # Create symbolic link to ​some place
 $ ln -s /path/to/file linkname

# Downloading data from the web
(example) $ wget http://domain.com/file

# To output terminal data to a, say, text file
$ command > somefile.extension
or to append data to that somefile:
$ command >> somefile.extension

# to outout stderr (standard error messages)
$ command &> somefile.extension
or to append:
$ command &>> somefile.extension

# to have that information printed and output to a file (stderr and stdout):
$ SomeCommand 2>&1 | tee SomeFile.txt
 - - (If you want the output only, drop the 2 above)

 # shows me the details for the boot_directory
 $ ls -F /boot

 # shps messages from the linux kernel
 $ dmesg
 or 
 $ dmesg -T | less (for a human readable version)

 #to shutdown the machine

 $ shutdown -r 15:30 "rebooting soon"
 or
 $ shutdown -r now

 # to poweroff the machine
 $ poweroff

 #Main config file for syslog is:
/etc/rsyslog.conf

#But can include other syslog results, such as:
$ IncludeConfig /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf

#system log info (say, for mail)

mail.info  -/var/log/mail.info
mail.warn  -/var/log/mail.warn
mail.err   /var/log/mail.err (note, no caching for these more severe messages)

# example
$ logger -p mail.info -t mailtest "test."

# to rotate log messages
/etc/logrotate.conf: 

include /etc/logrotate.d

# testing the logrotate configuration
$ logrotate -fv /etc/logrotate.conf

# Disk management
- to check disk space generally
$ df -h

/ is always a mount point

mounting, such as something like mkdir to mount new directories at mount points /

fdisk to manage partitians

$ fdisk -l (to display a list of extant partitions)

# linux file management commands
ext2, ext3, ext4, etc, and there are others

# examples:
$ mkfs -t TYPE DEVICE
$ mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sbd2
$ mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb3
$ mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb3

$ ls -l /sbin/mkfs*

# to mount a partition
$ mount /device/ /directory/where/mounted

# the mount command will show all file systems, including all virtual ones
# to unmount a device
$ umount /device that is being unmounted

# to create swap space
$ mkswap /space/for/swap
then
$ swapon /space/for/swap

# /etc/fstab
each entry is made up of 6 fields
device
mount system
file system type
mount options
dump
fsck order

multiple options can be create by adding commas with no spaces around the commas

# to view labels and UUIDs
$ lsblk -f

# for only UUIDs
$ blkid 

# can use e2label plus $PATH to change the label

## USERS

Try to stay at 8 characters of length of username
Traditionally, lower case, but no special characters

Information about users is stored in /etc/passwd:

$ ps -fu

/etc/shadow (only readable by the su account)

$ newgrp (to change to a new group before creating files)

GECOS field (hold over from old days in UNIX)

4 June 2021

# creating a new user

$ adduser -c ‘Comments’ -m [create the home directory] -s /shell/path
OR
$ useradd [options] username

# to assign the user a PW

$ passwd USERNAME

If I wanted to check out that password. Or check the last item in any file, I would run a command

$ tail -1 /etc/passwd
This gives the last item on the list (or -1 before the next empty line)

Also, we could use -g to specify a GROUP for the account

Or -g GROUP1,GROUP2 to denote adding the user to more than one group

or -G to add another group

-r to specify a system account
-d to specify the home directory

# to delete a user’s account
$ userdel [-r] username (to delete the user and the home directory)

# to update user accounts
$ usermod 
-c “COMMENT”
-g GROUP
-G ADDITIONAL GROUPS
-s /shell/path

#Group details are stored in /etc/group

#Group details are stored in /etc/group (added to GitHub)

# to add a new group
$ groupadd (using the most common -g to specify the gID)

# to delete a group
# groupdel

#to modify a group
$ groupmod (-n specificies or changes the name of the group)

# Account info is stored in /etc/passwd AND /etc/shadow files

$ sudo -l (lists commands available)
$ sudo command (run command as root)
$ sudo -u root (same as above)
$ sudo -u USER (run command as USER)

# switching to sudo account
$ sudo su
$ sudo su - (switch to superuser with root environment)
$ sudo su - USERNAME (switch to superuser with USERNAME environment)

# starting shells with different users
$ sudo -s (start a shell)
$ sudo -u root -s (same as above)
$ sudo -u USER -s (starting a shell as a USER)

# modifying the sudo configuration
$ visudo Edit the /etc/sudoers FILE

## TCP/IP Networking for Linux Admins

octet.octet.octet.octet
can be anything from 0-255

A 255.0.0.0
B 255.255.0.0
C 255.255.255.0

# to show current ip addresse:
$ ip addr
OR
$ ip a
OR 
$ ip address show 
OR 
$ ip a s

# to display IP configuration
$ ifconfig (deprecated)
$ ipconfig

consider human readable bames to IP addresses
short-host-names, etc

# determining hostnames
$ hostname
$ hostname -f (to determined fully qualified name)

# to edit (in ubuntu) hostname configurations, edit this file:
/etc/sysconfig/network

# Also 'host' and 'dig'
$ host phantomlandscapes.com provides IP addresses, and google mail server info

# /etc/hosts is local to the system

# can edit the order for resolutions by editing
/etc/nsswitch.conf FILE

# Networking, DHCP, etc
Ports 1-1,023 are common, well known, service ports (privileged ports)
22 - SSH
25 - SMTP
80 - HTTP
143 - IMAP
389 - LDAP
443 - HTTPS
# /etc/services (these service ports mentioned above)

# to configure ubuntu as a DHCP client:
Edit: /etc/network/interfaces

# to configure ubuntu with a static ip:
edit: /etc/network/interfaces

# ifup and ifdown can also be used to configure these settings

# Network troubleshooting
ping
traceroute
tracepath
netstat
ctpdump
telnet

$ ping -c COUNT HOST
$ traceroute -n
$ tracepath -n (-n to use IP addresses instead of DNS names)
$ netstat (-n, lists numerical addresses and ports, -i, lists interfaces, -r, shows the route table)
# other netstat flags:
-p [requires root privileges]
-l
-t
-u

$ tcpdump [packet sniffing tool] [requires root privileges]
-n (numberal addresses and ports)
-A (ASCII text)
-v (verbose mode)
-vv (more verbose)
-vvv (even more verbose mode)
Stopped with Ctr + C

# Listing and Managing Processes
$ ps [-e, for everything, -f, full format listing, -u USERNAME, for a specific user, -p PID, for information related to PID)

# Other ways to view processes
$ pstree
$ top
$ htop

# Starting and terminating processes
$ command and arguments, etc to start process (adding '&' after the command for it to run in the background)
$ Ctrl -c (kill foreground processes)
$ Ctrl -z (to suspend foreground processes)
