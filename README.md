# Various Scripts

> These are a small selection of scripts in various languages and contexts that I have deployed to make some kind of action quicker or cleaner. Some are related to little cleanup tasks or maybe are related to some kind of first pass through a document or something. While some may be connected the depolying csv module or pandas, etc, for python-izing when possible. I started with Python first, but that is changing as time happens. Lord willing, be will be more useful query scripts or notes added that are part of some project.
