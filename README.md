# Various Scripts

> These little collections of scripts in various languages and contexts that I have deployed to make some kind of action quicker or cleaner - or are simply repetition and learning. Some are related to little cleanup tasks or maybe are related to some kind of first pass through a document or something. While some may be connected the deploying csv module or pandas, etc, for Python-izing when possible. I started with Python first, but that is changing as time happens. Lord willing, there will be more useful query scripts or notes added that are part of some project or situation context.
