I like using the SQLite tool because I can import csvs to it to create new tables, or can create a new table from a sql file (which is what I have been doing since I found a cool csv to SQL converter)
Useful csv to sql converter: https://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-sql.htm (there are a bunch of them on the web)
