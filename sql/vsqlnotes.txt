I like using the SQLite tool because I can import csvs to it to create new tables, or can create a new table from a sql file (which is what I have been doing since I found a cool csv to SQL converter)
Useful csv to sql converter: https://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-sql.htm (there are a bunch of them on the web)

ACID
Atomoicity (all or nothing)
Constistency
Isolation of database
Durability of data

# I am finding that MySQL Workbench has some elements that seem harder than they should be to connect and use - but more experimentation with this tool will be forthcoming
# to get all users in a mysql instance
SELECT *
FROM mysql.user;

# Basically, what I have done here is create three tables in a dB built around movies, an original 'real' csv file, and two fake derived

I am currently breaking into MS SQL Server 2019 (management studio)

-- I am seeing something strange in MS SQL Server 2019 that is...weird. Where I normally would use a 'where' condition to filter a search of a table, that table data what i am using as my filter is being labeled as a table name.
-- Why would that be the case?

-- getting to know mySQL as used in sequelace
